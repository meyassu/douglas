Introduction

So far as we know . . . The Imperial Galactic Government 
decided, over a bucket of  jewelled crabs one day, that a hyper-
space expressway was needed in the unfashionable end of  
the Western Spiral Arm of  the Galaxy. This decision was 
rushed through channels ostensibly to pre-empt traffi c con-
gestion in the distant future, but actually to provide employ-
ment for a few ministers’ cousins who were forever mooching 
around Government Plaza. Unfortunately the Earth was in 
the path of  this planned expressway, so the remorseless 
Vogons were dispatched in a constructor fl eet to remove the 
offending planet with gentle use of  thermonuclear weapons.

Two survivors managed to hitch a ride on a Vogon ship: 
Arthur Dent, a young English employee of  a regional radio 
station whose plans for the morning did not include having 
his home planet blasted to dust beneath his slippers. Had the 
human race held a referendum, it would have been quite likely 
that Arthur Dent would have been voted least suitable to carry 
the hopes of  humankind into space. Arthur’s university yearbook 
actually referred to him as ‘most likely to end up living in a 
hole in the Scottish highlands with only the chip on his shoul-
der for company’. Luckily Arthur’s Betelgeusean friend, Ford 
Prefect, a roving researcher for that illustrious interstellar 
travel almanac The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, was more 
of  an optimist. Ford saw silver linings where Arthur saw only 
clouds and so between them they made one prudent space 
traveller, unless their travels led them to the planet Junipella

where the clouds actually did have silver linings. Arthur would 
have doubtless steered the ship straight into the nearest cloud 
of  gloom and Ford would have almost certainly attempted to 
steal the silver, which would have resulted in the catastrophic 
combustion of  the natural gas inside the lining. The explo-
sion would have been pretty, but as a heroic ending it would 
lack a certain something, i.e. a hero in one piece.

The only other Earthling left alive was Tricia McMillan, 
or Trillian to use her cool, spacey name, a fi ercely ambitious 
astrophysicist cum fl edgling reporter who had always 
believed that there was more to life than life on Earth. In 
spite of  this conviction, Trillian had nevertheless been 
amazed when she was whisked off  to the stars by Zaphod 
Beeblebrox, the maverick two-headed Galactic President.

What can one say of  President Beeblebrox that he has 
not already had printed on T-shirts and circulated through-
out the Galaxy free with every uBid purchase? Zaphod 
Says Yes to Zaphod was probably the most famous T-
shirt slogan, though not even his team of  psychiatrists 
understood what it actually meant. Second favourite was 
probably: Beeblebrox. Just be glad he’s out there.

It is a universal maxim that if  someone goes to the trou-
ble of  printing something on a T-shirt then it is almost def-
initely not a hundred per cent untrue, which is to say that it 
is more than likely fairly defi nitely not altogether false. Con-
sequentially, when Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived on a planet, 
people invariably said ‘yes’ to whatever questions he asked 
and when he left they were glad he was out there.

These less than traditional heroes were improbably drawn 
to each other and embarked on a series of  adventures, which 
mostly involved gadding around through space and time, 
sitting on quantum sofas, chatting with gaseous computers

and generally failing to fi nd meaning or fulfi lment in any 
corner of  the Universe.

Arthur Dent eventually returned to the hole in space 
where the Earth used to be and discovered that the hole had 
been fi lled by an Earth-sized planet that looked and behaved 
remarkably like Earth. In fact this planet was an Earth, just 
not Arthur’s. Not this Arthur’s, at any rate. Because his home 
planet was at the centre of  a Plural zone, the Arthur we are 
concerned with had found himself  shuffl ed along the 
dimensional axis to an Earth that had never been destroyed 
by Vogons. This rather made our Arthur’s day, and his usu-
ally pessimistic mood was further improved when he 
encountered Fenchurch, his soulmate. Luckily this idyllic 
period was not cut short by bumping into any alternate Uni-
verse Arthurs who may have been wandering around, possi-
bly in Los Angeles working for the BBC.

Arthur and his true love travelled the stars together until 
Fenchurch vanished in mid-conversation during a hyper-
space jump. Arthur searched the Universe for her, paying his 
way by exchanging bodily fl uids for fi rst-class tickets. Even-
tually he was stranded on the planet Lamuella and made a 
life for himself  there as sandwich maker for a primitive tribe 
who believed that sandwiches were pretty hot stuff.

His tranquillity was disturbed by the arrival of  a couriered 
box from Ford Prefect, which contained The Hitchhiker’s 
Guide to the Galaxy Mk II in the form of  a smarmy pan-
dimensional black bird. Trillian, who was now a successful 
newswoman, had a delivery of  her own for Arthur in the 
shape of  Random Dent, the daughter conceived with the 
donated price of  seat 2D on the Alpha Centauri red-eye.

Arthur reluctantly took on the role of  parent, but was 
completely out of  his depth with the truculent teenager. 

181Q_tx.indd   3181Q_tx.indd   3 9/7/09   10:30:379/7/09   10:30:37

Random stole the Guide Mk II and set a course for Earth, 
where she believed she could fi nally feel at home. Arthur 
and Ford followed, to fi nd Trillian already on the planet.

Only then is the Mk II’s objective revealed. The Vogons, 
irritated by the Earth’s refusal to stay ka-boomed, had engi-
neered the bird to lure the escapees back to the planet before 
they destroy it in every dimension, thus fulfi lling their origi-
nal order.

Arthur and Ford rushed at semi-breakneck speed to 
London’s Club Beta, pausing only to purchase foie gras and 
blue suede shoes. Thanks to the old dimensional axis/
Plural zone thing, they found Trillian and Tricia McMillan 
co-existing in the same space-time, both being screamed at 
by an emotional Random.

Confused? Arthur was, but not for long. Once he noticed 
the green death rays pulsating through the lower atmos-
phere, all of  the day’s other niggling problems seemed to 
lose their nigglyness – after all, confusion was not likely to 
slice him into a million seared pieces.

The Vogon Prostetnic had done his job well. Not only had 
he lured Arthur, Ford and Trillian back to the planet Earth, 
but he’d also managed to trick a Grebulon captain into 
destroying the Earth for him, thus saving the crew several 
hundred Vog hours’ paperwork with the munitions offi ce.

Arthur and his friends sit powerless in London’s Club 
Beta and can only watch as the ultimate war on Earth is 
waged, unable to participate, unless involuntary spasming 
and liquefaction of  bone matter counts as participation. On 
this occasion the weapons of  destruction are death rays 
rather than Vogon torpedoes, but then, one planet-killing 
device is pretty much the same as another when you’re on 
the receiving end . . .

According to a janitor’s assistant at the Maximegalon Uni-
versity, who often loiters outside lecture halls, the Universe 
is sixteen billion years old. This supposed truth is scoffed at 
by a clutch of  Betelgeusean beat poets who claim to have 
moleskin pads older than that (rat-a-tat-tat). Seventeen bil-
lion, they say, at the very least, according to their copy of  
the Wham Bam Big Bang scrolls. A human teenage prodigy 
once called it at fourteen billion based on a complicated 
computation involving the density of  moon rock and the 
distance between two pubescent females on an event hori-
zon. One of  the minor Asgardian gods did mumble that 
he’d read something somewhere about some sort of  a 
major-ish cosmic event eighteen billion years ago, but no 
one pays much attention to pronouncements from on high 
any more, not since the birth of  the gods debacle, or Thorgate 
as it has come to be known.

However many billions it actually is, it is billions and the 
old man on the beach looked as though he’d counted off  at 
least one of  those million millions on his fi ngers. His skin 
was ivory parchment and, viewed in profi le, he closely 
resembled a quavering uppercase S.

The man remembered having a cat once, if  memories 
could be trusted as anything more than neuron confi gura-
tions across trillions of  synapses. Memories could not be 
touched with one’s fi ngers, could not be felt like the surf  
fl owing over his gnarled toes could be felt. But then what 

181Q_tx.indd   5181Q_tx.indd   5 9/7/09   10:30:379/7/09   10:30:37

were physical feelings if  not more electrical messages from 
the brain? Why believe in them either? Was there anything 
trustworthy in the Universe that one could hug and hold on 
to in the midst of  a butterfl y storm, other than a Hawaliusian 
wind staunch?

Bloody butterfl ies, thought the man. Once they’d fi gured out the 
wing fl uttering a continent away thing, millions of  mischievous Lepi-

doptera had banded together and turned malicious.

Surely that could not be real, he thought. Butterfl y storms?
But then more neurons poured across even more syn-

apses and whispered of  improbability theories. If  a thing 
was bound never to happen, then that thing would reso-
lutely refuse not to happen as soon as possible.

Butterfl y storms. It was only a matter of  time.
The old man wrenched his focus from this phenomenon 

before some other catastrophe occurred to him and began 
its rough slouch to be born.

Was there anything to trust? Anything to take comfort 
from?

The setting suns lit crescents on the wavelets, burnished 
the clouds, striped the palm leaves silver and set the china 
teapot on his veranda table twinkling.

Ah, yes, thought the old man. Tea. At the centre of  an uncer-
tain and possibly illusory Universe there would always be tea.

The old man traced two natural numbers in the sand with 
a walking stick fashioned from a discarded robot leg and 
watched as the waves washed them away.

One moment there was forty-two and the next there 
wasn’t. Maybe the numbers were never there and perhaps 
they didn’t even matter.

For some reason this made the old man cackle as he leaned 
into the incline and plodded to his veranda. He settled with

much creaking of  bone and wood into a wicker chair that 
was totally sympathetic to the surroundings, calling to his 
android to bring some biscuits.

The android brought Rich Tea.
Good choice.
Seconds later the sudden appearance of  a hovering metal 

bird caused a momentary lapse in dunking concentration 
and the old man lost a large crescent of  his biscuit to the 
tea.

‘Oh, for heaven’s sake,’ grumbled the man. ‘Do you know 
how long I have been working on that technique? Dunking 
and sandwiches. What else are left to a person?’

The bird was unperturbed.
‘An unperturbed bird,’ said the old man softly, enjoying 

the sound of  it. He closed the bad eye that hadn’t worked 
properly since he’d fallen out of  a tree as a giddy boy, and 
examined the creature.

The bird hovered, its metallic feathers shimmering crim-
son in the sun’s rays, its wings beating up tiny maelstroms.

‘Battery,’ it said in a voice that reminded the old man of  an 
actor he had once seen playing Othello at London’s Globe 
Theatre. Amazing what you can get from a single word.

‘You did say “battery”?’ asked the man, just to confi rm. It 
could possibly have been ‘fl attery’, or even ‘hattery’. His 
hearing was not what it used to be, especially on initial con-
sonants.

‘Battery,’ said the bird again and suddenly reality cracked 
and fell to pieces like a shattered mirror. The beach disap-
peared, the waves froze, crackled and evaporated. The last 
thing to go was the Rich Tea.

‘Bugger,’ muttered the old man as the fi nal crumbs dissi-
pated on his fi ngertips, then he sat back on a cushion in the 

181Q_tx.indd   7181Q_tx.indd   7 9/7/09   10:30:379/7/09   10:30:37

room of  sky that suddenly surrounded him. Someone 
would be coming soon, he was sure of  it. From the dim 
caverns of  his old memories, the names Ford and Prefect 
emerged like grey bats to associate themselves with the 
impending disaster.

Whenever the Universe fell apart, Ford Prefect was never 
far behind. Him and that accursed book of  his. What was it 
called? Oh, yes. The Pitchforker’s Pride is a Fallacy.

That, or something very close to it.
The old man knew exactly what Ford Prefect would say.
Look on the bright side, old mate. At least you’re not lying down in 

front of  a bulldozer, eh? At least we’re not being fl ushed out of  a 

Vogon airlock. A room of  sky is not too shabby, as it happens. It 

could be worse, a lot worse.

‘It will be a lot worse,’ said the old man with gloomy 
certainty. In his experience, things generally got worse, 
and on the rare occasion when things actually seemed to 
get better, it was only as a dramatic prelude to a cataclysmic 
worsening.

Oh, this room of  sky seemed harmless enough, but what 
terrors lurked beyond its rippling walls? None that were not 
terrible, of  that the old man was sure.

He poked a fi nger into one of  the wall’s yielding surfaces 
and was reminded of  tapioca pudding, which almost made 
the old man smile until he remembered that he had hated 
tapioca ever since a bullying head boy had fi lled his slippers 
with the stuff  back in Eaton House Prep.

‘Blisters Smyth, you sneaky shit,’ he whispered.
His fi ngertip left a momentary hole in the clouds and 

through it the old man caught a glimpse of  a double-height 
sash window beyond and, outside the window, could that be 
a death ray?

181Q_tx.indd   8181Q_tx.indd   8 9/7/09   10:30:389/7/09   10:30:38

The old man rather feared that it was.
All this time, he thought. All this time and nothing has hap-

pened.

Ford Prefect was living the dream, providing the dream 
included residence in one of  Han Wavel’s ultra-luxury, fi ve-
supergiant-rated, naturally eroded hedonistic resorts, fi ll-
ing one’s waking hours with permanent damage amounts of  
exotic cocktails and liaisons with exotic females of  various 
species.

And the best bit: the expense of  this whole self-indulgent 
and possibly life-shortening package would be taken care 
of  by his Dine-O-Charge card, which had no credit limit 
thanks to a little creative computer tinkering on his last visit 
to The Hitchhiker’s Guide offi ces.

If  a younger Ford Prefect had been handed a blank page 
and asked, in his own time, to write a short paragraph detail-
ing his dearest wishes for his own future, the only word he 
might have amended in the above was the adverb ‘possibly’. 
Probably.

The resorts of  Han Wavel were so obscenely luxurious 
that it was said a Brequindan male would sell his mother for 
a night in the Sandcastle Hotel’s infamous vibro-suite. This 
is not as shocking as it sounds, as parents are accepted cur-
rency on Brequinda and a nicely moisturized septuagenar-
ian with a good set of  teeth can be traded for a mid-range 
family moto-carriage.

Ford would perhaps not have sold either parent to fi nance 
his sojourn at the Sandcastle, but there was a bi-cranial 
cousin who was often more trouble than he was worth.

Every night, Ford rode the fl eshevator to his penthouse, 
croaked at the door to grant himself  entry, then made time to 

181Q_tx.indd   9181Q_tx.indd   9 9/7/09   10:30:389/7/09   10:30:38

look himself  in the bloodshot eyes before passing out face 
down in the basin.

This is the last night, he swore nightly. Surely my body will revolt 
and collapse in on itself ?

What would his obituary say in The Hitchhiker’s Guide? 
Ford wondered. It would be brief, that was for sure. A cou-
ple of  words. Perhaps the same two words he had used to 
describe Earth all those years ago.

Mostly harmless.

Earth. Hadn’t something rather sad happened on Earth 
that he should be thinking about? Why were there some 
things he could remember, and others that were about as 
clear as a hazy morning on the permanently fogbound Misty 
Plains of  Nephologia?

It was generally at about this maudlin stage that the third 
Gargle Blaster squeezed the last drop of  consciousness 
from Ford’s over-juiced brain and he would giggle twice, 
squawk like a rodeo chicken and execute a near perfect for-
ward tumble into the nearest bathroom receptacle.

And yet, every morning when he lifted his head from the 
en suite basin (if  he was lucky), Ford found himself  miracu-
lously revitalized. No hangover, no dragon breath, not even 
a burst blood vessel in either sclera to bear witness to the 
previous night’s excesses.

‘You are a froody dude, Ford Prefect,’ he invariably told 
himself. ‘Yes, you are.’

There is something fi shy going on here, his rarely heard from 
subconscious insisted.

Fishy?
So long and thanks for all the . . .
Wasn’t there something about dolphins? Not fi sh, true, 

but they inhabited the same . . . habitat.

181Q_tx.indd   10181Q_tx.indd   10 9/7/09   10:30:389/7/09   10:30:38



11

Think, you idiot! Think! You should be dead a hundred times over. 

You have consumed enough cocktails to pickle not only yourself  but 

several alternate versions of  yourself. How are you still alive?

‘Alive and froody,’ Ford would say, often winking at him-
self  in the mirror, marvelling at how lustrous his red hair 
had become, how pronounced his cheekbones. And he 
seemed to be growing a chin. An actual chiselled chin.

‘This place is doing me good,’ he told his refl ection. ‘All 
the photo-leech wraps and the irradiated colono-lemming 
treatments are really boosting my system. I think I owe it to 
Ford Prefect to stay another while.’

And so he did.

On the last day, Ford charged an underwater massage to his 
credit card. The masseur was a Damogranian Pom Pom 
Squid with eleven tentacles and a thousand suckers which 
pummelled Ford’s back and cleaned out his pores with a 
series of  whiplash tapotement moves. Pom Pom Squids 
were generally hugely overqualifi ed for their work in the spa 
industry, but were tempted away from their umpteenth doc-
torates by the lure of  high salaries, plankton-rich pools and 
the chance of  massaging a talent scout for the music indus-
try and maybe getting themselves a record deal.

‘Have you done any talent-scouting, friend?’ asked the 
squid, though he didn’t sound hopeful.

‘Nope,’ replied Ford, bubbles streaming from his plexi-
glass helmet, face shining orange in the pleasant glow of  
rock phosphorescence. ‘Though I once owned a pair of  blue 
suede shoes, which should count for something. I still own 
one – the other is closer to mauve, due to it being a copy.’

The squid nipped at passing plankton as he spoke, which 
made conversation a little disjointed.

181Q_tx.indd   11181Q_tx.indd   11 9/7/09   10:30:389/7/09   10:30:38

‘I don’t know if  . . .’
‘If  what?’
‘I hadn’t fi nished.’
‘It’s just that you stopped speaking.’
‘There was a glint. I thought it was lunch.’
‘You eat glints?’
‘No. Not actual glints.’
‘Good, because glints are baby gloonts, and they’re poi-

sonous.’
‘I know. I was merely saying that . . .’
‘More glints?’
‘Precisely. You’re sure you’re not a talent scout then, or an 

agent?’
‘Nope.’
‘Oh, for zark’s sake,’ swore the squid, a little unprofes-

sionally. ‘Two years I’ve worked here. Talent scouts and 
agents coming out of  your suckers, they promised. Not one. 
Not bloody one. I was studying advanced kazoo, you 
know.’

Ford couldn’t resist a lead-in like that. ‘Advanced kazoo? 
How advanced can kazoo studies be?’

The squid was wounded. ‘Pretty advanced when you can 
play a thousand of  them at the same time. I was in a quartet. 
Can you imagine?’

Ford gave it a go. He closed his eyes, enjoyed the whup-pop 
of  the suckers on his back and imagined four thousand 
kazoos playing in perfect sub-aquatic harmony.

Some time later the squid enveloped Ford in half  a dozen 
tentacles and gently fl ipped him over. Ford opened one eye 
to read the squid’s badge.

I am Barzoo, read the tag. Use me as you will.
And underneath in smaller print:

181Q_tx.indd   12181Q_tx.indd   12 9/7/09   10:30:389/7/09   10:30:38



13

I am allergic to rubber.

‘So, Barzoo. What kind of  stuff  did you play?’
The masseur got his tentacles a-pumping before he 

answered, whipping up a fl urry of  currents.
‘Old songs mostly. Covers. You ever hear of  Hotblack 

Desiato?’
I have heard that name, Ford realized, but he couldn’t quite 

pin the memory down. Every day things got a little fuzzier.
‘Hotblack Desiato. Wasn’t he dead for a while?’
Barzoo cocked his head, thinking about this. The squid’s 

beak hung open, ignoring the tiny streaks of  plankton fl ash-
ing by.

‘Hey, if  you can’t remember, don’t worry about it. I’m 
having a few memory problems myself  in this place. Little 
things like how long I’ve been here, what my purpose in life 
is, which feet to put my shoes on. Stuff  like that.’

The squid did not respond and its tentacles rested heavily 
on Ford’s torso like old rope.

Ford hoped that Barzoo had not suddenly died, and if  
the squid had passed on to the energy stage would the suck-
ers lose their suck, or go into some kind of  death-suck 
mode? Ford had no desire to spend the rest of  his holiday 
having tentacles surgically removed from his torso.

Then Barzoo blinked.
‘Hey, buddy,’ sighed Ford, bubbles spiralling from his hel-

met. ‘Welcome back. For a second there, I thought . . .’
‘Battery,’ said the squid, beak clicking on the Ts. ‘Battery.’
I never noticed before, thought Ford, but that squid looks a lot 

like a bird.

Then the underwater massage cave dissolved and Ford 
Prefect found himself  deposited in a room composed of  
blue sky.

181Q_tx.indd   13181Q_tx.indd   13 9/7/09   10:30:389/7/09   10:30:38



14

A familiar fi gure sat in the opposite corner.
‘Ah,’ said Ford, remembering.
Guide Note: Remembering is generally a two-stage process involving 

dialogue between the conscious and subconscious parts of  the brain. 

The subconscious opens proceedings by throwing up the relevant mem-

ory, an act which releases a spurt of  self-congratulatory endorphins.

‘Well done, matey,’ says the consciousness. ‘That memory is really 

useful right now, and I couldn’t remember where I’d put it.’

‘You and me, pal,’ says the subconscious, delighted to have its con-

tribution acknowledged for once. ‘We’re in this together.’

Then the conscious reviews the memory in its in-tray and sends a 

message down to the sphincter telling it to prepare for the worst.

‘Why did you remind me of  this?’ it rails against the subconscious. 

‘This is awful. Terrible. I didn’t want to remember this. Why the zark 

do you think I shoved it to the back of  my brain?’

‘That’s the last time I help you out,’ mutters the subconscious and 

retreats to the darker sections of  itself  where nasty thoughts are housed. 

‘I don’t need you,’ it tells itself. ‘I can make myself  another personality 

out of  these things you’ve discarded.’ And so the seeds of  schizophre-

nia are sown with kernels of  childhood bullying, neglect, low self-esteem 

and prejudice.

Luckily, Betelgeuseans don’t have much of  a subconscious, so that’s 

all right then.

‘Ah,’ said Ford again, followed quickly by, ‘Crap.’
He stepped gingerly across the fl oor of  sky, noticing with 

a jolt of  surprise that one of  his legs fl ickered slightly for a 
moment.

I’m not real, he realized, which was enough to stick a pin in 
his permanently buoyant mood, but he recovered quickly, 
something which the room’s other occupant didn’t seem to 
have managed just yet.

‘Look on the bright side, old mate,’ he called to the 

181Q_tx.indd   14181Q_tx.indd   14 9/7/09   10:30:399/7/09   10:30:39

Earthman. ‘At least you’re not lying down in front of  a bull-
dozer, eh? At least we’re not being fl ushed out of  a Vogon 
airlock, remember that? A room of  sky is not too shabby, as 
it happens. It could be worse, a lot worse.’

And it shortly will be if  I’m right about what’s going on here, 
thought Ford, but he didn’t voice this opinion. Arthur 
looked as though he’d had quite enough bad news for one 
day.

Inter-planetary news reporter Trillian Astra spent a few 
anxious moments in the press bathroom before heading 
into the auditorium for possibly the biggest interview of  
her life. In the course of  a celebrated career, Trillian had 
spent a year undercover in prosthetics working as a Vogon 
clerk in the Megabrantis Cluster. She had lost her left foot 
to frostbite when mine raiders on Orion Beta had ram-
raided a madranite shaft, and more recently she had been 
attacked by a holistic orthodontist when she had the temer-
ity to question the effectiveness of  tooth-straightening 
chants.

The Galaxy knew Trillian’s name. At the height of  her 
career she was feared by shady politicians, movie moguls 
and pregnant single celebrities from Alpha Centauri to 
Viltvodle VI, but on this day she felt the spectre of  fear at 
her own shoulder.

Galactic President Random Dent. Her daughter. Simulcast from 
the University of  Maximegalon live to an audience of  fi ve hundred 

billion.

She was nervous. No, more than that. She was terrifi ed. 
Trillian had not seen her daughter since . . .

My God, she realized. I cannot remember precisely the last time I 
saw Random.

181Q_tx.indd   15181Q_tx.indd   15 9/7/09   10:30:399/7/09   10:30:39

Trillian tried to calm herself  with ritual.
‘You’re looking good for an old bird,’ she said to the 

mirror.
‘Do you really tink this, dahling?’ said the mirror, obvi-

ously highly offended by what paraded before its sensors. 
‘If  this is good, then you are having the low standards.’

Trillian bristled. ‘How dare you? If  you had seen what I 
have seen, if  you had been through what I’ve been through, 
then I think you might agree that I look pretty damn 
good.’

The mirror’s sighs rippled the eight gel speakers mounted 
in its frame.

‘Enough with the history lesson, dahling. I don’t factor in 
the past, I just comment on the present. And right now, let 
me tell you, you look like Eccentrica Gallumbits in her third 
cycle. And believe me, honey, by that old whore’s third cycle 
things were mostly liquid and gas. If  I were you, I’d buy 
myself  a good towel and a bathrobe and just . . .’

Trillian reached across and pounded her fi st against the 
mirror’s mute button.

When did they start to give mirrors character traits? She could 

remember when only top-end androids and the occasional very special 

door had the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation’s Genuine People Person-

ality feature.

Maybe Trillian didn’t want to hear what the mirror had to 
say, but she could admit to herself  that it was right.

She did look old. Ancient, in fact.
That’s because I am zarking ancient. A hundred and fi ve earth 

years old. What’s left of  me.

Over the years Tricia McMillan had been chipped away by 
her job as Sub-Etha reporter and soon only Trillian would 
remain. This was not simply a metaphorical statement: 

181Q_tx.indd   16181Q_tx.indd   16 9/7/09   10:30:399/7/09   10:30:39

Trillian Astra had always been prepared to sacrifi ce every-
thing for the network – her friends, family, various body 
parts.

She lost the foot on Orion Beta during the mining hos-
tilities. Seventy per cent of  her epidermis was seared off  by 
a plasma splash on the front line at the Carfrax Gamma 
Caves. Left hand and forearm were mangled by a desert 
crawler tread during the Dordellis Wars and her right eye 
poked out by a fl ag on a little pointy stick during a Wango-
Pango teeniebop ice-capade on Gagrakacka.

So, what was left of  Tricia McMillan was an original brain 
(with added nu-fl uid), one rebuffed eye, a couple of  cheeks 
(one buttock, one facial), an assortment of  minor bones 
and two and a half  litres of  human blood. The other three 
litres were not technically blood at all but tears harvested 
from a hive of  Silver-Tongued Devils, small mammals indig-
enous to the Hastromil system. They are relentlessly 
exploited because of  the usefulness of  absolutely every part 
of  their beings, from their hinged silver tongues to their 
very thought waves, which can be harnessed to an aerial and 
used to boost video signal reception if  you live down a hole. 
The same philosophers who cite the Babel fi sh as proof  
that God doesn’t exist also cite the unfortunately initialled 
STD as proof  that Satan does, an argument which even a 
potato with a charge running through it could see under-
mines their initial point. But what do they care? Head doc-
tors love controversy.

Ironically, Trillian was in Hastromil to cover a rally to pro-
tect the STD when she was run over by a Silver Tongue fl oat, 
constructed even more ironically from Silver Tongue hides, 
which irony she then trumped by receiving a Silver Tongue 
transfusion while wearing a ‘Protect the Silver Tongue’ T-shirt. 

181Q_tx.indd   17181Q_tx.indd   17 9/7/09   10:30:399/7/09   10:30:39

It was later reported, by Trillian herself, that all this local-
ized irony overload had caused the death of  eleven empaths 
attending the rally. Twelve, if  the empath known to be 
already depressed was added to the statistic.

Trillian smooshed the plaskin on her cheek. It was smooth, 
but a little over-stretched. The guy at the checkout had 
promised that her face would loosen out with wear. But it 
never had. On bad days, Trillian thought her face looked 
like a skull pushed into a balloon.

A network executive had once described her as: a slim, darkish 

humanoid, with long waves of  black hair, an odd little knob of  a nose 

and ridiculously brown eyes.

Not any more.
Today was one of  those bad days.
Random. After all these years.

Every time she looked into her daughter’s eyes, it was like 
staring into pools of  her own guilt.

Trillian slapped her palm against the mirror.
‘Ow! Hey!’ said the mirror, overriding the mute.
Trillian ignored it.
She needed to pull herself  together. She had at one time 

been the Galaxy’s most respected reporter and that was an 
achievement. She would force her regret into its box down 
in the pit of  her stomach and go do her job.

Trillian plucked at a strand in her helmet of  coiffed sim-
hair, squared her shoulders and walked into the auditorium 
to interview the daughter that had been conceived in a lo-
grav fertility satellite clinic near Barnard’s Star.

Trillian shuddered. As if  morning sickness had not been 
bad enough without lo-grav thrown into the mix.

Random had every right to feel displaced: her father 
was a test tube, her home planet, insofar as she had one, 

181Q_tx.indd   18181Q_tx.indd   18 9/7/09   10:30:399/7/09   10:30:39

had been destroyed in several dimensions and her mother 
had taken one look at her and decided to vigorously pur-
sue a career that would take her far from home for long 
periods.

No wonder Random was a little frosty.

President Random Dent sat cross-legged in a hovering egg 
chair onstage, chanting quietly.

‘Bicuspid lie behind canine behind lateral incisor behind 
central incisor. T-o-o-o-o-o-th, fi nd your place.’

The curtain had not yet been drawn, but she could hear 
the hubbub of  the crowd through the heavy material. The 
curtain was velvet, not holographic, an expense grudgingly 
borne by the university at Random’s insistence. While in no 
way anti-progress, the President believed that there was still 
room for tradition in the Galaxy.

She smiled softly as her mother was led on to the plat-
form. From a distance a person could be forgiven for think-
ing that their roles were reversed and that Trillian was the 
President’s daughter, but up close the truth was plain. Sur-
gery shine was written all over Trillian’s face.

The reporter’s step faltered as she caught sight of  her 
daughter, but she recovered herself  quickly.

‘You look well, Madam President,’ she said in that typical 
reporter’s accent, which was somewhere between Sector 
ZZ9 and Asgard.

‘As do you, Mother,’ responded Random.
Trillian settled into a second egg chair and consulted her 

notes.
‘President Random Frequent Flyer Dent. Still using too 

many names?’
Random smiled in the calm manner of  one who has been 

181Q_tx.indd   19181Q_tx.indd   19 9/7/09   10:30:409/7/09   10:30:40

tantrum-free for decades. ‘And you, Trillian Astra. Still using 
the wrong one?’

Trillian smiled tightly. This was not going to be an easy 
interview.

‘Why now, Random? We haven’t seen each other more 
than a dozen times in the past twenty years. Why now, when 
my career is on the wane? I go from beauty pageants on 
New Betel to the biggest interview of  my life.’

Random smiled again, a gentle creasing of  her outdoorsy 
face. Her grey-streaked hair was stiff  with sunshine and salt 
water.

‘I know it’s been a while, Mother. Too long.’ She stroked 
a small ball of  fur around her neck and it mewled softly. 
Trillian saw tiny teeth and a tail and her heart sank.

‘I’ve heard about that thing. Your constant companion. 
It’s some kind of  little gerbil, isn’t it? Cute.’

‘More than a cute gerbil, Mother. Fertle is my companion. 
A fl aybooz. Fully grown. A font of  knowledge, all transmit-
ted telepathically.’ And then she dropped the bomb. The 
career killer. ‘We were married yesterday.’

Trillian’s skin felt tighter than it had a minute ago. ‘You 
were married?’

‘It’s a mental bond, obviously. Though Fertle does like 
me to tickle his tummy.’

Keep it together, Trillian told herself. You are a professional.
‘Let me get this straight. You communicate telepathically 

with . . . Fertle?’
‘Of  course. Communication is what keeps families 

together. Haven’t you heard?’
At this point, Trillian stopped being a reporter and started 

being a mother.
‘Less of  the pay-back jibes, young lady. This is your life 

181Q_tx.indd   20181Q_tx.indd   20 9/7/09   10:30:409/7/09   10:30:40

we’re talking about. You are Random Dent, the President 
of  the Galaxy. You united the tribes of  Earth. You oversaw 
the offi cial fi rst contact ceremony.’ Trillian was on her feet 
now. ‘You spearheaded the economic drive into space. You 
negotiated for equal rights for aliens.’

‘And now I want something for myself.’
Trillian strangled an imaginary Fertle, six inches in front 

of  the real one. ‘Not a gerbil, though. Not a zarking gerbil. 
How is a gerbil going to give me grandchildren?’

‘We don’t want kids,’ said Random blithely. ‘We want to 
travel.’

‘What are you talking about? It’s a rodent.’
‘He,’ said Random pointedly, ‘is a fl aybooz, as you well 

know. And I thought you, of  all people, would understand 
our relationship. The formidable Trillian Astra. Champion 
of  all people, except her daughter.’

Trillian thought she detected a chink of  light in the gloom. 
‘Wait. What? This is about me? You are going to destroy 
your life to get back at me? That’s one hell of  a twisted 
revenge cocktail, Random.’

Random tickled her husband till he snickered. ‘Don’t be 
ridiculous, Mother. I wanted you here to introduce your 
son-in-law to the Galaxy. It will be your crowning moment 
as a journalist, and it will bring us together as a family.’

Trillian saw it all then, the genius of  Random’s coup de 
grâce. If  she announced this union in full 3-D Spectro-
Vision, then she would be a laughing stock. If  she did not, 
then her daughter was lost to her for ever and would prob-
ably milk the situation for enough sympathy to win another 
term in offi ce. At the very least, the fl aybooz would vote for 
her, and there were zillions of  those.

Trillian’s frame jerked spasmodically. Married!

181Q_tx.indd   21181Q_tx.indd   21 9/7/09   10:30:409/7/09   10:30:40

‘Forget it, Random, you’re not using me to put a spin on 
your relationship. As soon as I get out of  here, I’m going to 
track down your father and he can deal with you.’

Random shook with laughter, frightening her husband. 
‘Arthur! Do you have any idea how far he would go to avoid 
confrontation?’ She paused, cocking her head to one side. 
‘Fertle says, and I agree, that you have to announce this, 
Mother. The Galaxy is expecting big news.’

‘Absolutely not. I refuse to be manipulated.’
‘You’d rather be controlled by the networks, like the robot 

you are. I can hear you buzzing from here. I can smell your 
circuits. Is there any part of  you that’s real? Can you put me 
in touch with my human mother? Or perhaps you know 
where her backbone is buried.’

Trillian was almost relieved that the façade of  civility was 
scorched away.

‘Screw you, Random.’
The President nodded. ‘Yes, Fertle. This is how she is. 

Are you surprised now that I am diffi cult to read? At all the 
defences I have erected around my brain?’

Trillian was almost shrieking. ‘You are talking to a bloody 
yo-yo!’

Fertle seemed to react to this.
Guide Note: Though fl aybooz have no ears, they are extremely 

sensitive to vibration and can actually explode in extreme circum-

stances. Thor, the Asgardian and sometime rock god, held the record 

for spontaneous fl aybooz detonation when he debuted his new tune 

‘Let’s Get Hammered’ from a chariot in orbit around Squornshel-

lous Delta. The record had previously been held by intergalactic 

rock band Disaster Area, who dropped a speaker bomb into a 

volcano crater where the fl aybooz were enjoying a static electricity 

festival.

181Q_tx.indd   22181Q_tx.indd   22 9/7/09   10:30:409/7/09   10:30:40

Fertle’s fur bristled and he opened a tiny mouth that now 
seemed to have a beak.

‘Battery,’ said Fertle in a voice of  wire and claws.
‘What?’ said Trillian. ‘Did I just hear a fl aybooz speak? 

Now that would be news.’
‘Battery,’ said Fertle again, this time with some urgency.
The velvet curtain rose slowly, but there was no audience 

behind it, just an auditorium of  sky and two humanoid 
fi gures.

Random and Trillian stood and gaped, family resem-
blance clear for once in spite of  the various surgeries and 
implants.

‘What’s happening?’ said the President, her voice higher 
suddenly. ‘Mother? What’s happening? Where are my jour-
nalists?’

‘Don’t panic,’ said Trillian, trying to keep the quaver from 
her voice. ‘Something is happening here.’

‘Something is happening?’ shrilled Random. ‘That’s it? 
All of  your years in the fi eld and all you can come up with 
is something is happening. This is a kidnap attempt, that’s what 
it is. We’ve been transported somewhere.’

Trillian squinted at the humanoid fi gures who seemed to 
be growing increasingly familiar, as though scales of  forget-
fulness were falling from her eyes.

‘Kidnapped. I don’t think so. Not by these two. They’re 
harmless . . . mostly.’

Random adopted her favourite presidential power posi-
tion, feet planted, arms crossed.

‘You two men. What have you done? I demand to know 
where we are.’

The shorter man noticed the new arrivals; it was pretty 
likely that he would as one of  them was shouting at him.

181Q_tx.indd   23181Q_tx.indd   23 9/7/09   10:30:419/7/09   10:30:41



‘I think the question should be when we are, then possibly 
who put us here, followed by is there a drinks trolley?’

Random scowled. ‘Is there a drinks trolley indeed. Be 
fl ippant all you like, young man. I know that underneath 
you’re as scared as we are.’

The young man smiled. ‘I’m Betelgeusean, Random. We 
don’t do underneath.’

Random lost the urge to riposte when the sudden recog-
nition of  the second man hit her like a Surprise-O-Plasm 
pie in the face.

‘Father? Daddy? Dad?’
‘Pick one,’ suggested the Betelgeusean. ‘It will make con-

versations easier.’
Trillian took off  across the room of  sky, moving faster 

than she had in years.
‘Now, let’s see what your father has to say about this mar-

riage.’
Random suddenly seemed a lot younger. ‘Daddy!’ she 

howled. ‘Daddy! My stupid mother hates my husband.’
The father fi gure dropped his head and wished for tea.
